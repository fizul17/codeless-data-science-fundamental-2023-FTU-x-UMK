# Codeless Data Science Fundamental 2023 FTU x UMK

Welcome to the class
## Introduction
This repository is about Data Science Fun. It is implementing KNIME Codeless Tool for doing data science analytics

# The topic: Land Use In Malaysia.

# Abstract 

The report will present about use land in Malaysia to classify land use type from satellite imagery or other geospatial data. The analysis will show the land has been use in Malaysia in what type, that has been categorise in a few types. For an example, the land use for human activities or environment in ecosystem. In this programming also we decided to do analysis for how land use in Malaysia.

# Introduction 

Malaysia have 11 state in Peninsular, Sabah and Serawak which is  the area 127 560.2 km. Malaysia has a few land area that has been reserve for the ecosystem and for the habitat  for animals and so on. This is to protect the nature from disaster from human or something that disturbance the habitat and supply chain. 

Land is the place that people can stay, build the building, agriculture and etc. The land use in Malaysia has some of benefit for economic sector, investment and etc. For an example, build public transportation such as train, roadside and so on, farm or agriculture area for economic in Malaysia. The development of the country should have a good plan to ensure we are not over use the nature.
	
The  land use also have and bad side to our nature because of the waste when building, and waste from the human that are stay at the building. This can be effect the nature for an example water pollution, air pollution and etc. Pollution disruption to the ecosystem for an example of supply chain of the ecosystem. 


# Methodology 

The methodology that in my report and that I have been use in knime application is Data collection, Data reprocessing, Data analysis and data visualition to process my data to show that what i need in my last output. The output that has been clean and can be a data that show what we can improve in the feature. 

1.	Data collection

In this section, I have collect the data from the government post that show the land use in Malaysia. https://archive.data.gov.my/ . The data have the year that the do research, how many land has been use in the area and total of all the area of the land use. 

2.	Data reprocessing

The function that I has been use in my program is:

•	csv reader, to read the data in my program.
•	Column filter, to filter the column the which there have any problem 
•	Missing value, fix the missing value to the data that can be use in the program. 
•	Cache, clear the data that not has been use in the program.
•	Colour manager, helps to fix either nominal or numeric column. 
•	Table view, display the data in an HTML table view. 

3.	Data Analysis

The data will be fix for a few category to make the user easy to understand which is need in that program. This also helps to category the data for a few category that are suitable for it, so we are easy to visualize the data. The pattern of  the data can be show in pie chart,  bar chart, table and scatter plot. 

4.	Data visualization  

The data will be show in the pie chart, bar chart, table and scatter plot. The data the we already has been analyse such as prediction and what part or area that use the land that we can recognize which is more and less. Then we can do the planning for the feature.


# Experimental result

  The pie chart will present that in our country will devided to a few catogory. All this data present in all area but different type, so we can see what land in malaysia use for. For an example, the most frequently land has been use in malaysia is in agriculture. The profe is malaysia is rich with plam oil tree. 

<img width="1136" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 6 19 26 PM" src="https://github.com/fizul17/codeless-data-science-fundamental-2023-FTU-x-UMK/assets/93848356/a689d0b8-3c84-4684-aeda-2abecd032926">

  The bar chart are present about the total sum for every single sector that land use but in this we can see more detail on every part in this. This is bacuse bar chart show more detail rather than pie, pie chart just show summarise of the land use in every sector. The less of the that has been show in this project is use for beach. This is bacause of beach only have in a few state in Malaysia and its not use a huge area to clarify that is beach. 

<img width="1080" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 6 19 53 PM" src="https://github.com/fizul17/codeless-data-science-fundamental-2023-FTU-x-UMK/assets/93848356/c24b0357-861f-4e0d-861a-2f853129119e">

  This single sample T test is the probabilities that land in that area are use it, some other area that also clarify that sector but it not has been use it fot that. For an example, the most land use in Malaysia is for sector agriculture but some area not use it for that but just use for farming.

  This simple three show the total of the land in Malaysia. At the same time, all the land in Malaysia will divide to a few area. The show land are most use in Malaysia are nostly in "Seberang Perai" which is there have 3 area north, south and middle. So we can se that the development of the county are not balance at all areas.

<img width="1136" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 6 22 00 PM" src="https://github.com/fizul17/codeless-data-science-fundamental-2023-FTU-x-UMK/assets/93848356/2b430890-1061-42c5-b044-f64a65480880">

  The line plot show about the predection of the land use in malaysia are high in year 2021. Then keep going down, except "Timur laut". This is can be related to the enviroment, goverment and financial. If the have a good financial and the govement for that sate is good also can helps then to increasingly lively in future.
  
  
# Conclusion 

The conclusion for  this project is to ensure the land use is balance with development to our country. The prediction from this project we can use for the measure that we have a balance development and will not effect lots of our ecosystem. This prediction also we can use to create a plan for the feature to ensure all are smooth and run smoothly.
